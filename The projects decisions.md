The projects decisions (and why I made them.)

About:
>This project is the result of being inspired by the pokemon games. And believing that I can produce a similiar game that has just as much fun and character as the beloved series. Not as much depth or as big of a scale, but I wish to be able to invoke the same feelings as the games I've grown up with.

Technical decisions:
>Orix Launcher:
>>The decision to use my pre-existing library / engine stems from something I believe is called, common sense? A lack of desire to redo work, to save time and most importantly, to demonstrate the library I have made to anyone interested.

>The language:
>>C is being used as the main language for the project.
This is for 3 reasons, portability, familiarity and compatibility.

>>Portability:
>>>C can be put onto playstation 1, N64, DS, GBA, Windows, Linux, Mac, Webasm, pretty much anything. This means that I'm able to move this onto basically any device I'm interested in working with, granted elbow grease will be needed for the weaker systems but it should still provide a fun challenge..

>>Familiarity:
>>>I have been working with C as my main language for around, 3 or so years now? And C++ for 2 or so years before that. and as a result of this writing C code is practically second nature to me. So much so that it's the first thing I get working on any new environment (as well as Raylib and VSCode).

>>Compatibility:
>>>This is more in reference to the precious point of integrating with the Orix engine as well as with Raylib. (although Raylib will need to be swapped out if I ever use a non-pc non-openGL system.)
